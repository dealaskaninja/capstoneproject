          Upon launching the app, users will have the option to provide personal
          information such as name, age, gender, and disability status, among
          others. While this information is not mandatory, providing it can
          significantly enhance the app's ability to assist users effectively.
          Additionally, users will be prompted to indicate whether they require
          assistance or if they are offering assistance, such as providing rides
          to nearby shelters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once inside the app, users will be greeted with a map interface
          displaying their current location along with nearby shelters. By
          clicking on a shelter icon, users can access detailed information
          about that specific shelter, including contact details, operational
          hours, and the availability of beds or rooms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shelter4u goes beyond basic shelter information. It provides tailored
          options for individuals with specific needs, showcasing shelters that
          cater to physical and mental disabilities, accommodations for couples,
          spaces for individuals with pets, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app includes a dedicated section for job openings curated for
          homeless individuals, aiming to connect them with employment
          opportunities. Additionally, there's a section to assist those seeking
          support for drug addiction, alcoholism, and mental health challenges.
          Furthermore, Shelter4u offers a platform for agencies, donors, and
          compassionate individuals to extend their support. They can post
          available assistance, services, or donations directly on the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          For users offering or seeking rides, there's a separate section where
          a queue system operates. Both drivers and riders are required to
          provide their information and ID for safety purposes, and location
          tracking ensures enhanced safety measures for all involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Businesses and agencies interested in acquiring tablets for the
          Shelter 4u program are encouraged to prominently display the app
          within their establishments, ensuring easy accessibility for
          individuals seeking assistance. Placing the tablet in a visible and
          accessible location and affixing a Shelter4u sign or sticker outside
          the establishment signifies the availability of vital resources for
          those in need. By showcasing Shelter 4u, businesses and agencies
          actively contribute to creating an inclusive environment, facilitating
          connections between individuals experiencing homelessness and
          essential support resources.
